    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>12 oz macaroni pasta, cooked in salted water (gluten free or regular)</li>
        <li>¼ cup vegan butter</li>
        <li>¼ cup gluten free all purpose flour (or regular AP flour)</li>
        <li>2 ½ cups plain unsweetened oat milk (or other unsweetened plant-based milk)</li>
        <li>3 cups shredded vegan cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1 tsp kosher salt</li>
        <li>½ tsp ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook pasta in salted water according to package directions. We use 1 teaspoon of salt per 4 cups of water. </li>
        <li>In a medium pot, melt butter over medium heat. Once completely melted, whisk in gluten free flour until it forms a smooth paste. </li>
        <li>Slowly stream in milk, whisking well, until completely incorporated. Let simmer for a few minutes until it starts to thicken, stirring occasionally to prevent burning. </li>
        <li>Add in salt, pepper and vegan cheese and stir well. Vegan cheese takes a bit longer to melt, so keep stirring over medium heat until fully incorporated into a thick, smooth, cheesy sauce. </li>
        <li>Add in cooked pasta and stir well until fully coated. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
